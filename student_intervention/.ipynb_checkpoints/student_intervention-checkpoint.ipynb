Also can suffer if the value of a particular feature is not available in the training set, even if it could be important for making predictions on the testing set. It will perform poorly when features are not independent and more complexity is needed for the predictive model.\n",
    "    * *Fit for Problem*: Given that the sample size is relatively small and that we only need to know whether or not a person will graduate rather than the probability this will occur, GNB could work well because of it's simplicity and the cost constraints. Even though the features in the dataset are almost certainly not independent (health and absences for example), the model could still perform well enough in just offering up a prediction on whether or not the student will graduate (http://www.aaai.org/Papers/FLAIRS/2004/Flairs04-097.pdf)\n",

    "**Answer: ** I chose the support vector machine (SVM) because it had the best performance in terms of accuracy with reasonable training and prediction times. While model training time increases significantly for the SVM as the amount of data in the training set increases, the relatively small datasets mean that the training times between the SVM and a simpler model like Gaussian Naive Bayes are marginally different (less than 1/100th of a second). In addition, SVM performs marginally better than the more complext AdaBoost model in terms of accuracy and is significantly faster. Therefore, SVM offers the best tradeoff between accuracy and speed of the models evaluated, and its main limitation, the inability to handle large datasets, does not appear to be a big factor in this situation. Finally, the ability to tune parameters for SVM allows for some potential increase in model performance unlike Gaussian Naive Bayes."

The 'margin of separation' can be thought of as a border between the two groups of students. The SVM calculates this border by taking the various characteristics of the students into account and then adjusts the shape and location of the border to maximize the space to the border for both groups of students. In order to predict whether or not a student will graduate, the model takes the student's characteristics and determines which side of the border the student falls in, and then predicting that the student will fall in that group."
